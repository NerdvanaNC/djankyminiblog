      A public mini blog where people can post anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stories, letters, thoughts, journal entries, jokes, anything. Posts have a
      once-a-day limit, and require an account. Works just like a personal blog,
      WYSIWYG with a generous character limit.

      Not trying to replace Reddit, just wanted a practice project. I feel like
      this is a great proof-of-concept for a place where people can have a
      public journal. Since this is strictly text-only, the experience is akin
      to reading letters.

      Pretty sure this'll just devolve into ASCII dicks if it ever really goes
      out into the world, but a very fun project nonetheless; I learnt a lot!
