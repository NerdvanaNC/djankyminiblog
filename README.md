# DjankyMiniblog

An idea I had for a place where people could type out letters, stories, thoughts, or basically anything in a shared space.

You require an account to post, and a person can only make one post a day. Just like a personal blog, people can post whatever they want.

Not trying to replace Reddit; just need practice projects.
